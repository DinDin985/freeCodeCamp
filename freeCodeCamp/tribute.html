                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>Before we begin with this wonderful and bizzare story I need to explain some background information about what happened before the Capture The Flag Event started. But don't worry I'm not transfering you back to high school and explaining some history about WWI that no one cares about. However I will give you a quick rundown of Shia LaBeouf's campaign. It all started back in 2017 where Donald Trump was just elected president. Shia had some plans to speak out on the event and decided to go to the Museum of the Moving Image and paint on the wall "He Will Not Divide Us". Just to be clear I'm talking about The Museum of the Moving Image in New York, not The Museum of The Moving Image in London. If I had a nickel for every time there was a nickel every time there was a museum named The Moving of The Moving Image, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot of money, but it's weird that it happened twice. Anyways the plan was for the exhibit at the museum to run for four years, since you know an American presidency term is four years. Now you may be asking what could possibly be at this exhibit. Well along with the “He Will Not Divide Us” phrase being painted on the wall there was a camera and microphone running 24 hours, 7 days a week and most importantly Shia would frequently be at the exhibit repeating the phrase “He Will Not Divide Us”, as a side note this whole event took place outside. Now you may be thinking that this is some of the most bizzare and weird things to happen, and you’d be correct, but it gets better. From day one people came by to see the exhibit, but the internet decided to do it’s thing and troll Shia. From people talking and showing pictures of Pepe, to a guy renaming the Museum of The Moving Image to The Museum of KEK, to people pretending to be racist nazis. I absolutely love this because I love dark humor, but I also find it hilarious how far people will go out of their way to piss off someone. However after five days Shia had an incident where he assaulted a supporter due to a misunderstanding. He was then arrested and a fence was placed and only allowed five people to come in. However this is just the beginning.</p>
                        <p>TLDR: Shia ran an anti-trump message that involved a 24/7 stream and people from the internet came by and trolled Shia with racist jokes and Pepe.</p>

                        <h2>The Next Phase</h2>
                        <p>After the what happened during the first event of Shia's anti-trump campaign he decided to change things up a bit. Instead of placing his catchphrase in a public area he decided to raise a flag with the same phrase in the middle of no where. For all we know no one knew where this flag was located besides Shia himself. And context clues were scarce since the camera was pointing straight up the sky with only clouds, sky, and flag in sight. So what happened?</p>

                        <p>In a a shocking speed of 38 hours and 14 minutes the flag was found and taken down. If this does not prove the power of the internet then I don't know what will. This has been a story of The Greatest Game of Capture The Flag.</p>
                        <p>If you think this has been a great read don't thank me, thank Internet Historian who made a whole video of the event. I didn't really do much besides copy and paste what he said. I just wanted to use the video to practice on making a website and for fun.</p>
